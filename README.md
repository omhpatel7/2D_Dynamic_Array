# 2D Dynamic Array Implementation in C

This C code provides a basic implementation for a two-dimensional dynamic array. It includes functions for allocation, deallocation, storage, and retrieval of elements. The code demonstrates how to handle arrays of integers and floats, along with a simple test function to verify functionality.

## Features:

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The code provides functions to dynamically allocate memory for a two-dimensional array.
- **Storage and Retrieval**: Functions are included to store and retrieve elements in the array.
- **Test Functions**: Test functions are provided to verify the correctness of storing and retrieving values, including tests for integer and floating-point values.

## Code Structure:

- **Node Struct**: Defines the structure of a node for a linked list.
- **Array Allocation and Deallocation**: Functions for allocating and deallocating memory for the array.
- **Storage and Retrieval**: Functions to store and retrieve elements in the array.
- **Test Functions**: Functions to test the implementation for integers and floats.
- **Main Function**: Invokes the test functions and demonstrates the usage of the implemented functionalities.

## Usage:

1. **Compilation**: Compile the code using a C compiler (`gcc` or `clang`).
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable to execute the provided test functions.
3. **Customization**: Modify the test functions or integrate the provided functionalities into your project as needed.

## Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    // Compile the code
    // Run the executable
    // See the test results
    return 0;
}
